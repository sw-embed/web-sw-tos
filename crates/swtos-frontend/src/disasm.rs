//! Decode COR24 instructions from bytes alone.

//! The debugger's `dis` reads its answers from the build's debug map, which
//! covers only the statically linked image. A spawned process runs a private
//! copy of a catalog image somewhere in the arena, and its program counter is
//! an address the map has never heard of, so `dis` refused exactly where a
//! person most wants it.
//!
//! Decoding needs no map. The ISA crate encodes every instruction, so
//! inverting its encoders gives a complete table from opcode byte back to the
//! instruction, exact by construction rather than by a second table written
//! out by hand and left to drift.
